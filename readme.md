# Farseer.Windows.Universal (Monogame)

This is a port of the Farseer Physics Engine (Monogame) to the Windows Universal Platform. There were made some minor changes to make it able to be compiled.

Original Code can be found at [project homepage on codeplex](https://farseerphysics.codeplex.com/).

## Support

I can't give any support to this library. It worked for me somehow, so if there are problems, maybe ask the Farseer developers or the [Monogame community](http://community.monogame.net/).
